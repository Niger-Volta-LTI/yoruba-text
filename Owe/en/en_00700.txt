The maize plant is not a human being; who ever saw children on the back of elephant grass?
One should not overestimate the value of things. When the maize plant develops fruits the Yoruba say,“Ó yọ ọmọ” literally, “It has sprouted a child.” The expression does not, however, mean that the people believe that the plant is human. Elephant grass is almost identical to maize in size and looks, even though it bears no fruit.
